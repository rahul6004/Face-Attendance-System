***--Inroduction--***
In the ever-evolving landscape of our interconnected world, the imperative to safeguard information and physical assets has reached unprecedented levels of importance and complexity. Traditional access control systems, relying on items like ID cards and passwords, have proven susceptible to exploits, resulting in incidents such as credit card fraud and computer hacking. Recognizing the need for a more robust approach, biometrics has emerged as a transformative technology, authenticating individual identity through physiological or behavioral traits.

Biometric access control methods, exemplified by technologies like face recognition, leverage unique features such as fingerprints and facial characteristics. This not only provides a more secure means of identification but also introduces a formidable deterrent against forgery and manipulation. Face recognition, distinguished by its exceptional accuracy and non-intrusive nature, has captured the attention of diverse disciplines since the early 1970s. Researchers in security, psychology, image processing, and computer vision have all been drawn to the multifaceted applications and potential advancements offered by this cutting-edge technology.
